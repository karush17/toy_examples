## Toy Examples

This repository is a collection of Machine Learning tasks as toy examples. The purpose of this repository is to impart programming and machine learning knowledge in the form of short assignments. Tasks can range from beginner to moderate difficulty and do not require constructing large codebases. However, tasks require prior knowledge of machine learning and reinforcement learning systems along with their usage in running experiments.

## Guidelines and Honor Code

Each task is designed to be completed on a single GPU / TPU. While the training part does not take long, code implementation and ebugging can take anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks. Note that if you are beginner, it might take longer than 2 weeks to arrive at a few solutions. While there are no strict protocols on how the tasks should be completed, it is essential that learners complete the task independently, ie- without AI assistance.

## Tasks

Note that the personal completion time varies for each learner depending on time availability and learning speed. Learners with prior experience in machine learning and programming could take 2 days to 2 weeks to finish a task. Beginners would take longer.

|Task|Solution|Personal Completion Time|

|Implement and train a shallow transformer model to generate random numbers between 0 and 100. Generate a new sequence using the model and visualize the learned distribution of random numbers. Your implementation should be written in JAX and submitted as a single `.py` or `.ipynb` file.|[`rand_transformer.ipynb`](rand_transformer.ipynb)|2 days|
